= Synopsis
  require 'mkmf/lite'

  class System
    include Mkmf::Lite

    def initialize
      @gecos = have_struct_member('struct passwd', 'pw_gecos', 'pwd.h')

    def some_method
      if @gecos
        # Do something
      end
    end

= Description
  The mkmf library that ships as part of the Ruby standard library is not
  meant for use as an internal library. It's strictly designed for building
  C extensions. It's huge, its methods sit in a global namespace, it contains
  many methods you don't care about, and emits output to $stdout that cannot
  easily be disabled.

  The mkmf-lite is a module, it's small, and it's designed to be mixed into
  classes. It contains a handful of methods that, most likely, will be used
  in conjunction with FFI. It does not package C extensions, nor does it
  generate a log file of any sort.
